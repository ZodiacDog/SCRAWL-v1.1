# SCRAWL-in-SCRAWL: Fused Attention Pipeline
#
# Full attention computation: identity verification → tensor setup
# → attention routing → result extraction.
#
# This demonstrates SCRAWL expressing its own attention subsystem
# as a native program — the ISA is expressive enough to implement
# the operations it was designed to support.

# ── Step 1: Identity verification (trust before compute) ──
CR0 = identity.derive(seed=0xF00D, depth=8)
R1 = identity.verify(CR0, R0)

# ── Step 2: Self-attention on input tensor ──
# TR0 contains the input (loaded externally before execution)
TR3 = attention.self(TR0)

# ── Step 3: Yield verification status ──
yield R1
